How much I wished for another
Better, happier, brighter future
Here I am at the gate I stand
Dear old times
I've made up my mind

How much you must have suffered through
My anger (you wonder)
Vulgar (forward)
Awkward (sincere)
Composure (manners)
Here we are at the fated land
Will you watch me end? (I shall make it end)

Oh-oh
Round and round we go
Holding on to pain
Driven by our egos
Feelings (feelings) untold
Spinning our own versions of the past
That you could never know
'Cause I know

I must be the reason why
You have given up your smiles
And the hope inside your eyes have been stolen
I must be the reason why
You must tell me all these lies
Wishing you a better life without me by your side
The message has already been said through patches of violet

How much we must have diverged
Hello (goodnight)
Goodbye (hello)
Goodnight (were ain't here)
Goodbye (waiting?)
Here we are, it's our final chance
With your hand, do what must be done



Delete
Delete
Delete
Delete
Delete, delete, delete, delete
Delete, delete, delete, delete
Delete, delete, delete, delete
Delete, delete, delete, delete


Oh-oh
Round and round we go
Holding on to pain
Driven by our egos
Feelings (feelings) untold
Spinning our own versions of the past
That you could never know
How would I know?

I could be the reason why
You were able to be kind
And the hearts we held so tight won't stay broken
Love must be the reason why
I still believe in this lie
That you'll live a better life without me by your side
