I walked down a path
Leading to the past
Stole from the tree's hands
A regretter's friend; The forbidden fruit
I bite off the skin
Chewing on its tender flesh
Quaff down its lukewarm puss
You've became the "me" who you despised
We've swallowed the time, let us rewind

Lament!
If you wanted me to speak
If you wanted me to think
If you wanted me to carry on our dreams
Each loop we live through
Each loop we live through
The standards inside me
The line I drew for me
Lowers to the earth

Lament!
Why'd you make my voice stutter?
Why do truths never matter?
Why'd you curse me with "You're a natural born genius"?
Endless inferno (Inferno)
Counter-clock we rose
Counter-clock we reload

Tick tick tock
Replayed thoughts
Forget me not
I'm inside the empathic light
I bite off your skin
Exposing the angels on your ribs
They stare at us
"Hello, how may I help you today?"
"Please, a one-way ticket to heaven"

Buckled up on velvet seats
Sceneries were passing by
Not so different from our hell
Not so different from our home
Then I realized someone's heaven
Could be the source of my torment
Life is allowing yourself
Allowing yourself to step on fire (Life is to consume)
Shed tears on bloodied routes (Life is to become food for each other)
(No matter evil or good)
Eternally in hell we live... (Life is fairness, life is inequality)
(Life is in the motion...)
By default

Lament!
If you wanted me to live
If you want me to forgive
If you want us to pretend like we're civilized humans
Each loop we die through
Each loop we die through
The justice inside me
The ego fending me
Rationalize my sin

Lament!
Why do deaths end my torture?
Why can't anyone feel my hurt?
Why'd you crown the most violent to be champions?
In this inferno (Inferno)
We built for ourselves
(Reviving) each other in this hell
