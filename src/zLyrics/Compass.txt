Bon voyage
Your mermaid's setting sail at last
Full speed towards your heart
Full speed towards your heart

I've had enough
I'm reclaiming myself
The aft
Leaving behind the hurt
Leaving behind the hurt

When it snapped
My compass was swallowed by the sea
My compass was swallowed by the sea
I curse this relationship between you and me

I wanted blood
I wanted black and white
Clear-cut
Your evils predefined
Your evils predefined

Hold on tight
My compass is curiosity
My compass is curiosity
I'm piercing through the roof that strangled you and me
Let us be free

High tide, low tide
High tide, low tide
High tide, low tide
High tide, low tide
