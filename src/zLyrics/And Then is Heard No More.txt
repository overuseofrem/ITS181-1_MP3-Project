Do the candles look forward to being used?
Enjoy bidding adieu, adieu?
Every word I have saved for you came out wrong afterwards.
So I spoke no more...
Would you say that someone who had every intention to be brave was a coward...?



Must be great being you, Power comes as second nature.
Must feel amazing, to be longed for, longed for.
I opened my eyes, Cemented excuses to my lashline.
So I could see no more...

So which home should someone as weak as I go...?
And which sky should I aim for when Iâ€™ve only been low...? (I have only been low)
Day and night your ghosts continue to haunt me.
Tell me who to be ...

If I went with you, will there be happily-ever-afters?
Sipping on tea I steeped together, together
Read me a story of a hero born knowing the all (Read me a book of me) .
So I could hear no more
