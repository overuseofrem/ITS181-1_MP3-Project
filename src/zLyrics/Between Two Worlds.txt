(Realm of Light)
Oh
It's this time of the year
A very
So merry
Night we hold dear
So many
So many
Regrets bring me to tears
Not many
Not many
Notice or care
Oh, my saviour
Oh
Why does a common fire have so much power?
If only we could be
Forever naive and pure
If only we could lead
Painless futures
If only there could be a forgiving world

(Realm of Darkness)
Maybe that was when
I chose to stay fallen
Lights
A star
A voice
A twisted thought
A touch
A kiss
A distorted dream
Ripples
A well
A stone
A multiplying desire
A fruit
A sin
A holy mother
I'm infected
I'm infected
You have invaded
And recreated me
Stepped over my body
Found a sunny spot
Curled into a ball
Spinning out the silk
From my head to toe
Inside my warm cocoon
I dreamt to be like you
Though I know there's no undo
What do I have left to lose
Split
A sky
An earth
I fell into a crack
A birth
An egg
A freshly opened membrane
A cell
A rot
A face returned to ashes
An art
A wound
A sentient canvas
Breaking breaking breaking the shell
Breaking out
Oh break it now
Show me how
Show me how
Listen up, my broken child
Let's lament (Let's lament)
Let's lament (Let's lament)
The life, the death
The good, the bad
The never-ending curse we cast
Control, control, control, release
Control, betray, control, let go
Conceal, reveal, unreal, surreal
Invoke, evoke, decode, reload
Let's lament (Let's lament)
Let's lament (Let's lament)
The past that only got to live
In the incomplete holy land
Celestial (Ayiah)
We're astral (Ayiou)
I'm reborn (Le rheaiah)
Total liberation (Katre o lamenta)
My tender skin
A vagitus song (Essential)
I breathed (Eventual)
And screamed (Eternal)
From my new lungs (Inevitable freeing of the soul)
