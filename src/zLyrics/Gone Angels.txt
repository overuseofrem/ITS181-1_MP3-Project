Look
One by one
The pages remind me you'll always be a villain
For you, angels have fallen
Now they're gone
See? Now they're gone
Forever gone
From the hell that served as my one and only home
Though it may hurt today
Tomorrow I'll be heading my way

I tried, I tried
What did we expect?
My dearest friend
Tell me when we shall make it end

So let me take your hand
Like one of those madmen
Tip tappity tappity tap
Dance our last dance
Sing
Ta talila lulilatu
La tulali lalulilu
Spinning vinyl opera

(Lascia ch'io pianga)
Longing for this moment
(mia cruda sorte,)
Brewing all this hatred
(e che sospiri)
So I have a reason
(la libert√†.)
Reason to see you dead

Don't you worry
I saved a spot for you in recycle bin
Your neighbouring addresses point to the books you burned

Stop now
One by one
Your desires convince me you've always been a human
For you, the shelves have fallen
Now they're gone
See? Now they're gone
Forever gone
From the stage that allowed us our one and only dreams
What's more to say?
Pain always catches up to those who chooses to stay
Though it may hurt today
Tomorrow I'll be heading my way
