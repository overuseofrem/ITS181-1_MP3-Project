Sleep for a total of 800 hours per day
And then drink a liter of milk
Warm-up before you go play
Only eat, or write
Or pull the trigger with your right hand
Only thing that's left
Is to work on following commands

By the time you realize
You'll be restrained to a desk
And with your dreams on the floor, you comply
Eyes chained to the test
In 30 minutes, find a groom or bride
Bonus if brunette
In 90 hours, spill their insides
Paint your room picturesque

Now it's time for another vendetta
Going through the shelves
Picking out my pre-written persona (ha-ah-ah)
Children of the city sees only the neon stars
Reflected upon the murky gutter sky
Don't ask me why
I desperately wish to be included in the city's night

[In four hundred thousand meters, turn right]

Pick up a knife and stab a familiar warm body
Learned to fight before I knew love or bitterness of coffee
Snippy scissors cut down the strings
I set myself free
Only to figure out everything I chose was by proxy

As we suckled upon the nine millimeter pacifier
Swallowing the fact that other than to expand
We had no purpose
As my ever-burning will to stay afloat backfires
I now know I must be comfortable being
Who I considered worthless

Follow the city's ribbon
To a heart nobody seems to listen
It takes my heart being broken and broken again (broken and broken again)
To know that I am the reason why (the reason why)
The sufferings never end

Now it's time for another vendetta (hmm-mmm-mmm)
Going through the shelves
Picking out my pre-written persona (ha-ah-ah)
Children of the city sees
Only the neon stars
Reflected upon the murky gutter sky
Don't ask me why
I desperately wish to be noticed by the city's night
