Yes, I have been so afraid
Yes, I have been so distant
Consistently indifferent
It's hard to put that in an amicable sentence
I'm sorry
Actually, not really

There's just so much work
Too much work to be done
Committing to commitments
Hiding my indulgence
The freedom we sacrifice for love

L-O-V-E-L-O-V-E
(L-O-V-E-L-O-V-E) You also made me unafraid
(Yes I'm da brave boi)
You gave me light (filament)
You're patient (physician)
Persistently listen (gentlemen)
It's hard to describe what I'm feeling at the moment
Are you (uh-huh?)
Uhm (yes?)
I mean
(You're) In love with me

It's just so much fun
Too much fun
Oh, come on
How could you say no? (Don't say no)
To the fast and furious swan boat (flamingo)
The excitement we mistake for love
L-O-V-E-L-O-V-E
L-O-V-E-L-O-V-E

Though I enjoyed it all
Still, I have my doubts
You're a nice girl
I'm just not ready now
But then mommy said
It ain't family biz
Get over it

Toughen up
Just like the man we expected
So when are you gonna take the chance?
Let us be one
We are one (la-la)
All for one (la-la)
One for everyone

We stick together
Family is forever
Inside the train, we walked down the aisle
Furthermore
Our love opened the door
To a vehicle I'd rather not enter
Seconds later, a new future
I know that I agreed to this myself (myself, myself)
I wish it was their fault

Now I regret
Wish we were dead
Before we started feeding on each other
Blood is thicker
But the drink I prefer is water
Now that it's over (wish we never)
Listened to them (forged up our hearts)
Mixed up our souls (let's pretend)
That it didn't happen

Forbid (forbid)
Forgive (forgive)
Forget
L-O-V-E-L-O-V-E
L-O-V-E-L-O-V-E
Love, love
